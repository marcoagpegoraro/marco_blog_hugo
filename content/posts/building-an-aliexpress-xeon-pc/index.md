So, a few days ago i bought a new case for my old gaming PC that i built in the covid 19 period to play games, my old case was very old and it was falling apart, literally. So a made a video explaining how i transferred the parts to the new case.

After the pc was ready to use, i then installed the PC in my living room to play games in my TV using my XBOX controller, the problem is, my office didn't have any PC anymore. Thats when i have an idea to build a new PC using parts from Ali Express, such as the RAM, Processor and motherboard.
